# Project Overview
## Executive Summary
This project transforms a fragmented set of transaction, customer and product spreadsheets into a single, interactive Excel dashboard that answers the core business questions about coffee sales: what sells, where, to whom, and when. 

The dashboard allows business users to explore sales trends over time, compare performance by roast type and size, measure loyalty-card impact, see geographic distribution, and identify the highest-value customers, all using Excel tools (PivotTables, slicers, and formulas). The output supports rapid, data-driven decisions for marketing, product management and customer success teams.
## Business Problem
Prior to this project the coffee business relied on static, manual spreadsheets for reporting. The pain points were:
- No single source of truth for sales aggregated across orders, customers and products.
- Insufficient visibility into temporal trends (seasonality, growth).
- Hard to compare sales across countries, roast types, and package sizes quickly.
- No simple way to evaluate loyalty card effectiveness or to identify top customers for retention/upsell.
- Manual reporting took considerable time and was error-prone.

Those issues limited the ability to run targeted promotions, allocate inventory, or prioritise customer outreach.
## Project Objective
Deliver a repeatable, documented Excel-based analysis and dashboard that:
- Consolidates Orders, Customers and Products into a consistent dataset.
- Answers the 8 core business questions (trend, geography, roast, size, loyalty, top customers, coffee type, cross-country preferences).
- Presents an interactive dashboard (timeline slicer, roast/size/loyalty slicers, charts).
- Provides documented formulas and reproducible steps for others to follow and extend.
- Produces actionable recommendations and a hand-off path to scale (Power BI / SQL) if needed.
